# Peppa UI/UX Design Challenge
This is my submission for the Peppa UI/UX Design Challenge. I have created a generic minimalist and aesthetic design for an abitrary e-commerce website. The design is created using Figma.

## Main Submission Files
The main submission files are:
- [The Figma File](Nour%20Ashoush%20Figma%20Design.fig)
- [The Video Presentation](Nour%20Ashoush%20Video%20Presentation.mp4)

Alternatively, the Figma design can also be accessed online via [this link](https://www.figma.com/design/mllDVV9rzSkiY9SXsRBCAA/Peppa-UI%2FUX-Design?node-id=0-1&t=ZoTOCmp5w1pBmylB-1).

## Viewing the Prototype
The design is responsive and has both mobile and desktop views. Ideally, they should be viewed on Figma with the following displays:
- **Mobile:** iPhone 14/15 Plus *or* iPhone 14/15 Pro Max
- **Desktop:** Macbook Pro 14"

Alternatively, the interactive desktop prototype can be accessed online via [this link](https://www.figma.com/proto/mllDVV9rzSkiY9SXsRBCAA/Peppa-UI%2FUX-Design?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-2&viewport=389%2C320%2C0.07&t=F66ErD3fDOSq6TmM-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&share=1&show-proto-sidebar=1).
