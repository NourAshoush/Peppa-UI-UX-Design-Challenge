# Peppa UI/UX Design Challenge
This is my submission for the Peppa UI/UX Design Challenge. I have created a generic minimalist and aesthetic design for an abitrary e-commerce website. The design is created using Figma.

### Viewing the Prototype
The design is responsive and has both mobile and desktop views. Ideally, they should be viewed on Figma with the following displays:
- **Mobile:** iPhone 14/15 Plus *or* iPhone 14/15 Pro Max
- **Desktop:** Macbook Pro 14"

*For your convenience, images of all pages created are provided in the [mobile folder](./Mobile%20Pages/) and [desktop folder](/Desktop%20Pages/).*
